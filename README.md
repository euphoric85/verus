# verus scripts

install-verus.sh

This is a guided install script for the Veruscoin cli wallet


stakenotify.sh

This script sends Pushover and/or Pushbullet notifications for incoming wallet transactions.  This is really useful for staking; you can be notified on any compatible device that you staked coins so you know you need to login to your wallet to shield them.  By default it also notifies you of mined coins, if you solo mine through the wallet, as well as any coins received from other wallets.
