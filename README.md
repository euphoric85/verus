# Verus scripts
Helpful scripts in testing for use with Verus.  Please note I am not a developer, admin nor official member of the Veruscoin team.
The official Veruscoin github is here: https://github.com/VerusCoin

Any of these you use are AT YOUR OWN RISK

## install-verus.sh

This is a guided install script for the Veruscoin cli wallet

## stakenotify.sh

This script sends Pushover and/or Pushbullet notifications for incoming wallet transactions.  This is really useful for staking; you can be notified on any compatible device that you staked coins so you know you need to login to your wallet to shield them.  By default it also notifies you of mined coins, if you solo mine through the wallet, as well as any coins received from other wallets.
